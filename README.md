# Genetic Algorithm Solutions for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of genetic algorithms for solving the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**. The code is designed to model and optimize logistics problems by simulating natural selection processes. A PDF version of the code is included for offline reference.

## Repository Contents

- `Gene2c Algorithm Solu2ons to Capacitated Vehicle Rou2ng Problem.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python implementation of genetic algorithms for CVRP.

- `coding.pdf`  
  A PDF version of the code and explanations included in the notebook.

## Key Features

1. **CVRP Overview**  
   - Mathematical formulation of the problem, including objectives and constraints.  
   - Explanation of CVRP instances and their practical applications in logistics and transportation.

2. **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**  
   - Core genetic algorithm components: population initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.  
   - Visualization of customer locations and optimal routes.

3. **Advanced Techniques**  
   - Adaptive mutation and elitism strategies for improving optimization efficiency.  
   - Multiple route splitting methods: greedy, dynamic programming, and heuristic approaches.  
   - Fitness tracking and route visualization over generations.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Real-time plotting of routes and fitness progress during the genetic algorithm's execution.
